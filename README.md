## Project Overview

**Minishell** is a project aimed at creating a simple shell that replicates the behavior of Bash. It serves as an educational tool to deepen understanding of how shells operate, focusing on aspects such as command parsing, execution, environment management, and signal handling.

## Key Features

- **Prompt Display:** Shows a prompt awaiting user input.
- **Command Execution:** Handles execution of both built-in and external commands.
- **Pipes and Redirections:** Supports command chaining using pipes and file redirections.
- **Environment Variables:** Manages environment variables, allowing their retrieval and modification.
- **Signal Handling:** Manages signals like `Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+D`, and `Ctrl+\` to ensure proper shell behavior.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the main source files for the shell.
- `include/`: Header files with function prototypes and macros.
- `lib/`: External libraries or helper functions.
- `Makefile`: Automates the compilation process.

Each directory and file is structured to promote modularity and clarity, facilitating maintenance and scalability.

## Installation

To set up and run **Minishell**:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/madao-cc/minishell.git
   ```



2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd minishell
   ```



3. **Compile the Project:**
   ```bash
   make
   ```


   This will generate the `minishell` executable.

## Usage

To start **Minishell**, run the executable:

```bash
./minishell
```



Once running, the shell will display a prompt awaiting user input. You can enter commands as you would in a typical Unix shell.

## Implementation Details

### Command Parsing

The shell reads user input and parses it to identify commands, arguments, and operators (like pipes or redirections). This involves:

- **Lexical Analysis:** Tokenizing the input string to identify command components.
- **Syntax Analysis:** Building a parse tree or similar structure to represent the command sequence and their relationships.

### Execution Flow

After parsing, the shell proceeds to execute the commands:

1. **Built-in Command Check:** Determines if the command is a built-in function and executes it directly.
2. **External Command Execution:** If not a built-in, the shell searches for the executable in the system's PATH and creates a child process to run it.
3. **Pipes and Redirections:** Sets up necessary pipes and file descriptors to handle command chaining and input/output redirections.

### Signal Handling

The shell handles various signals to ensure a smooth user experience:

- **Ctrl+C (`SIGINT`):** Interrupts the current command but keeps the shell running.
- **Ctrl+D:** Signals end-of-input, causing the shell to exit.
- **Ctrl+\ (`SIGQUIT`):** Typically ignored or handled to prevent the shell from quitting unexpectedly.

### Built-in Commands

**Minishell** implements several built-in commands, such as:

- `echo`: Prints arguments to the standard output.
- `cd`: Changes the current directory.
- `pwd`: Prints the current working directory.
- `export`: Sets environment variables.
- `unset`: Unsets environment variables.
- `env`: Displays the environment variables.
- `exit`: Exits the shell.

### Error Handling

The shell includes robust error handling to manage scenarios such as:

- **Command Not Found:** Alerts the user when a command cannot be located.
- **Permission Denied:** Informs the user when they lack permissions to execute a command.
- **Syntax Errors:** Detects and reports issues like unmatched quotes or invalid command sequences.

## Learning Outcomes

Through developing **Minishell**, you will gain insights into:

- **Process Creation and Management:** Understanding how to create and control processes using system calls like `fork`, `exec`, and `wait`.
- **Inter-Process Communication:** Implementing pipes and managing file descriptors for data flow between processes.
- **Signal Handling:** Learning to catch and respond to various signals to control process behavior.
- **Command Parsing:** Developing techniques to interpret and validate user
